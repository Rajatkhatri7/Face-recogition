# Introduction
Face recognition is a crucial security application. Through this project, a very basic form of face recognition has been implemented using the Haar Cascades Classifier, openCV & K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm.
 

# machine learning and Opencv
In this repository we are using opencv along with machine learning algorithm to classify the different faces by name in the image and in live video.
